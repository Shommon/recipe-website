    <h1>Fenithir's Alchemy Recipes!</h1>
        <p>Welcome to Fenithir's Alchemy Recipes! I, Fenithir Shinebright have provided to the arcane network access to a public database of all of my alchemy recipes. There are some recipes that require level 9 access that my assistant Benni created, and to gain access to those you should contact us at <strong>askfenithir@shinebright.com</strong>. For general questions or appointment scheduling you can contact my assistant <em>Thalin</em> at 1-800-653-2451. Thank you and I hope you find these recipes marvelously bright and shiny! </p>
