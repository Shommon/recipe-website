        <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Step 1: </strong>Start by finding a quiet and peaceful space in your alchemical laboratory. Ensure that you have all the necessary components laid out before you.</li>
                <li><strong>Step 2: </strong>In a clear glass vial, combine 1 cup of purified water and a pinch of powdered unicorn horn. This is where the magic happens, as unicorn horn is a rare and powerful magical ingredient.</li>
                <li><strong>Step 3: </strong>Stir the mixture gently in a clockwise direction with a silver stirring rod. The clockwise motion is essential to unlock the magic within the unicorn horn.</li>
                <li><strong>Step 4: </strong>After stirring, add two sprigs of the common healing herb, which will enhance the potion's healing properties. Let them float in the mixture for a moment.</li>
                <li><strong>Step 5: </strong>Finally, place a small clear quartz healing crystal into the vial. This crystal will further amplify the potion's healing energy.</li>
                <li><strong>Step 6: </strong>Seal the vial with a cork or stopper and leave it undisturbed in a cool, dark place for 24 hours. During this time, the potion will absorb and infuse with the magical properties of the unicorn horn, healing herbs, and crystal.</li>
                <li><strong>Step 7: </strong>After the 24 hours, your Potion of Healing is ready to use. When you consume it, it will restore a moderate amount of hit points, rejuvenating your character in times of need.</li>
